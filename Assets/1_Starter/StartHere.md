# Social XR Testbed

## Starter Kit

**07 April 2021**

We re-ordered the project, cleaned up the scenes, and documented the scripts to make a basic version of the Social XR testbed that will hopefully be easier to build upon moving forward.

All folders with 'Old' in their titles (Old Scenes, Old Scripts) are not needed for the starter scenes to work.

For reference, here's a list of all the scripts (24 in total) that _are_ needed to make this work:
